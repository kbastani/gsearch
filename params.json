The core libraries of gSearch contain a collection of graph management services for recording and analyzing complex dynamical systems of temporally modeled interactions.\r\n\r\n![gSearch](https://raw.github.com/kbastani/gsearch/master/Images/gsearch-logo-thumb-200x200.PNG)\r\n\r\n## What problems does gSearch solve?\r\n\r\ngSearch is meant to solve specific problems in the field of information retrieval and search.\r\n\r\n### Filter\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Recommendation\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Causality\r\n\r\ngSearch allows you to painlessly perform causal analysis of temporally modeled events.\r\n\r\n#### Definition\r\n\r\n![Causality](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality) (also referred to as causation) is the relation between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is understood as a consequence of the first.\r\n\r\n#### Theory\r\n\r\nObservations are made, captured, from a perspective of a position in time and space. A graph is a model of that space.\r\n\r\nA graph database provides you a means to model space and see information from the perspective of a point relative to other points. Those points can represent a condition or state of the world.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nConsider the example below.\r\n\r\n* Pam met Sally.\r\n* John met Sally.\r\n* Sally met Anne.\r\n* Anne met Pam.\r\n\r\nEach point on the graph is from the perspective of a person relative to meeting other people.\r\n![Event_Model](https://raw.github.com/kbastani/gists/master/meta/event-model-1.png)\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n\r\nThe need to model these abstract representations of interactions between objects in a temporal sense, ordered chronologically, requires database management solutions that are complex and contextually diverse.\r\n\r\n![Event_Interaction_Model](https://raw.github.com/kbastani/gists/master/meta/TSEMM-Temporal-Binding.png)\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\ngSearch exposes an API for handling data management operations purposed to performantly manage read and write operations for creating and maintaing a causal graph in your Neo4j graph database.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
